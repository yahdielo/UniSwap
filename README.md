# UNiswap 

in the repo Swap token contract contains a smart contract that inherits from uniswap IswapRouter and 
is able to swap ERC-20 tokens, assuming the funds are inside the smart contract and not in a external wallet.

 As the idea of this is to implement the fucntions to swap tokens inside the flashloan contract to e able to trade the boorrow funds.
